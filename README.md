[Data Analyst with SQL Server](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-sql-server?version=2) @ [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

## Topics Covered
### Course 1: Introduction to SQL Server
- Selecting one or more columns with SELECT, Ordering results with ORDER BY, and Filtering results using WHERE and HAVING clauses
- Aggregating and summarising using SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX and AVG, and Text manipulation with LEFT, RIGHT, LEN and SUBSTRING
- GROUP BY for splitting results into groups of interest Basic Joins - using INNER, LEFT and RIGHT joins
- Combining data from different tables with UNION and UNION all
- Transforming data using CASE statements
- Creating tables, and inserting, updating and deleting records
- Creating and using variables for more efficient queries, and creating temporary tables

### Course 2: Introduction to Relational Databases in SQL
- Transformed data sets step by step into the database schema on the right â€“ only by executing SQL queries
- Defined column data types, added primary keys and foreign keys
- Specified relationships between tables to guarantee better data consistency and therefore quality

### Course 3: Intermediate SQL Server

### Course 4: Time Series Analysis in SQL Server
- Used date functions and also combine DATEADD() with DATEDIFF() to round off to the nearest minute or hour
- Learned how to use CAST(), CONVERT(), and FORMAT() to turn dates into strings for reporting
- FORMAT() can be an order of magnitude slower than the others
- Calendar tables
- Converted strings into dates by CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE() functions, even when the string uses a different locale
- TRY_CAST(), TRY_CONVERT(), and TRY_PARSE() are just as fast and are also type-safe: NULL value instead of an error when the string does not parse to a date
- Learned how SQL Server keep track of time zones using offsets and how to translate dates between time zones and changing time zones altogether
- Reviewed aggregation functions like COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), etc.
- Reviewed statistical aggregate functions like AVG(), STDEV(), and VAR()
- Aggregate data using ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS
- Time series problems: window functions are, both for ranking functions like ROW_NUMBER() and RANK(), but also for aggregate functions like SUM() or AVG()
- Calculate running totals and moving averages over windows of data
- Learned how to look backward and forward in time with LAG() and LEAD(), respectively
- Learned how to calculate the maximum level of overlap, important for discovering concurrency in data sets

### Course 6: Database Design

### Course 7: Transactions and Error Handling in SQL Server

### Course 8: Writing Functions and Stored Procedures in SQL Server
